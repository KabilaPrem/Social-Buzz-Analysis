# 🧪 Reaction Analysis on Content Performance

This project analyzes user reactions to various content pieces based on sentiment, reaction type, and scores. It was completed as part of the **Accenture Data Analytics & Visualization Simulation**.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains user reaction logs including:
- Reaction type (e.g., disgust, interested, scared)
- Sentiment (positive/negative)
- Score (user reaction intensity)
- Content category and type
- Timestamp (date and time)

## 🔍 Objectives

- Identify most common reaction types to content
- Analyze sentiment distribution by category
- Detect spikes in negative or high-score feedback
- Propose improvements for content engagement

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Data cleaning, pivot tables, charts)
- PowerPoint (Presentation dashboard)

## ✅ Key Insights

- Majority of negative reactions (`disgust`, `dislike`) were tied to a specific content category ("Studying").
- Content scores ranged from 0 to 50, with the highest engagement seen in positive sentiment content.
- Reaction types varied significantly by time of day — user sentiment was more positive in late afternoon.
